Communication between Leek components is secured with different Authentication and Authorization mechanisms.

## Agent to API

Authentication between the agent and the API is insured using API key header and additional headers providing request 
context to Leek API as it will be receiving requests from different agent subscriptions and it should know which leek 
application to index the events to. Requests sent from agent to the API must include these headers:
                        
- `x-leek-org-name` - the organization name is the domain name if leek user signed up with a GSuite google. for instance 
**ramp.com**, and google account username if leek user signed up with personal google account.

- `x-leek-app-name`: the application name chosen when the application was first created.

- `x-leek-app-key` - the API key secret. it will be generated by leek api when the application is created.

## WEB to API

Authentication between the web application and backend is insured using Firebase JWT Token provided after the user logs 
in. the API will validate the token before processing any request, making sure that the JWT token is valid and also 
checking if the user is allowed to call the target endpoint as some endpoints like purging application and deleting 
application are only permitted for application owners. and other endpoints are only authorized for leek admins.
