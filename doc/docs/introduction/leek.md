### What is Leek?

Leek is a celery tasks monitoring tool, the main difference between Leek and other celery tasks monitoring tools is that 
Leek can connect and monitor many brokers with a single container whereas with other tool you can monitor only a single 
broker at a time.

Also leek supports environments branching, multiple applications, Google SSO, charts, issues monitoring, advanced 
filtering and search, indexation and persistence, slack notifications and provides an awesome UI for a better user 
experience.

Leek came to remediate the issues found with other celery monitoring tools and provide a reliable results and cool 
features to ease the process of monitoring your celery cluster, finding and respond to issues quickly.

### What Leek is not?

Leek is not a celery tasks/workers control tool and you cannot use leek to revoke/terminate tasks or restart your 
workers fleet, however control features could be supported with the future releases.

Leek is not package but a full stack application docker image.
